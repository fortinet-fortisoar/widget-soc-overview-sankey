## Overview

The FortiSOAR&trade; Overview Sankey widget helps visualize the flow between nodes in a directed acyclic network. Sankey diagrams are a data visualization technique or flow diagram that emphasizes flow, movement, or change from one state to another. The width of the arrows is proportional to the flow rate of the depicted extensive property.

A Sankey chart widget can be a valuable visualization tool in FortiSOAR for illustrating the flow of data or processes between different stages. In FortiSOAR&trade;, they can help represent the flow of security incidents, alerts, or data through various automated processes:

1. **Incident Workflow Visualization:**
   - Use the Sankey chart to visually represent the workflow of security incidents as they progress through different stages of analysis, investigation, and resolution.
   - Nodes in the chart can represent different stages, such as "Incident Detection," "Investigation," "Enrichment," "Response," and "Resolution."

2. **Alert Triage and Escalation:**
   - Visualize the triage and escalation process for security alerts within the FortiSOAR&trade;. Nodes can represent different alert severity levels, and the links can show how alerts are triaged, escalated, or deescalated.

3. **Data Enrichment:**
   - Show how data enrichment processes contribute to the overall analysis of security incidents. Nodes can represent different enrichment tools or processes, and links can indicate the flow of enriched data.

4. **Integration Points:**
   - Display integration points with external systems, such as threat intelligence feeds, ticketing systems, or other security tools. Nodes can represent these external systems, and links can show data exchange or integration points.

5. **User Activity and Access:**
   - Use the Sankey chart to visualize user activity and access patterns within the FortiSOAR&trade; environment. Nodes can represent users or roles, and links can show their interactions with different systems or processes.

6. **Custom Metrics and KPIs:**
   - Customize the Sankey chart to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics relevant to the FortiSOAR&trade;'s goals, such as incident resolution time, automation efficiency, or alert response times.

7. **Real-time Monitoring:**
   - Integrate the Sankey chart into a real-time monitoring dashboard within FortiSOAR&trade; to provide analysts with a dynamic and up-to-date view of the security operations flow.
